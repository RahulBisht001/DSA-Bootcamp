Let we have a Graph with n Nodes and m edges.

Spanning Tree :
  
      is a subGraph of the Graph which contain n nodes same as the Graph but contains only n-1 Edges and all 
Nodes are Reachable from each Other.

     A spanning tree is a sub-graph of an undirected connected graph, which includes all the vertices
 of the graph with a minimum possible number of edges.  If a vertex is missed, then it is not a spanning tree.
  

Minimum Spanning Tree :

          A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree in which the sum of the
 weight of the edges is as minimum as possible.
